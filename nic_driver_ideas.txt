the driver is written in assembly for me
already. i think the easiest thing for
me to do is to have all the assembly
files, then have a C interface to
those things

after combing through the driver they
provided, i think it makes more
sense to port it over to C. at least
the parts that will interface with
other drivers.

to do this i will need to tidy up
how the PIC and IDT handle adding
interrupt handlers
