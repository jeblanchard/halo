i want cmake to allow me to compile my
unit tests properly

what is the best directory layout for test source
and test executable output?
    - i think having test source directories within the
      source code structure is good
    - and having a test output that matches the source
      directory layout makes sense as well

actually, instead of test directories i think simply
appending _test to the test source code is better
    - there's nothing that forces us to create a test
      directory for every source code directoy (unless
      there is some sort of CMake thing that I have to
      configure that I'm not thinking about right now?)

what if we have a CMakeLists file for each source directory (no
explicit test directory) that includes all the files that end with
a specific suffix (_test.c)

create tests for the modules that i listed in my resume!

i want the tests to compile for all platforms. all the other
source code has to compile for the i-32 architecture that
bochs is emulating

how do i compile the kernel code without including all of
the cmocka tests?
