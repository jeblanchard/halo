use the cmocka framework

have a main method for each test directory? i think this is the best option.
this will keep the manual coupling a low as possible by keeping everything
in the same directory.

i can then write a script that will execute every collection of
tests.

my script can throw an error when it doesn't find what it is
looking for
- such as test directories, or the correct C file name

we need to compile all of the tests before we can run them

have a script that compiles all tests to an output directory

have a script that runs all the tests stored in that output
directory

compilation of source code should be less stringent then how
the test source is compiled - i can add this later.

the object files that were generated from compiling the source
can be just be linked with the compiled tests

because there are many entrypoints if i were to compile everything, i assume
an error would be thrown. i think no matter what there needs to be
an executable for each testing group.

i could have a script that goes into every testing group and compiles everything,
then another script that actually runs these. and maybe these scripts can just be
nested.
