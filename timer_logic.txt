maybe i can add a function that changes
the mode of the screen?

there can be timer mode and default mode

timer mode would display a timer at the
bottom of the screen and not let anything
get in its way

default mode would be the default screen

would having a screen object be best for
this? the screen object is something
that can be referenced by the functions
that rely on it.

all the print functions would need
to know about the state the screen is
in

that feels like a lot to think about
each time we want to add a screen method

we could just have a variable that represents
the screen mode

we can have variables for printable rows
(and printable columns) that can be updated
with a function call

we can have a function that sets the maximum
row we can write to

we can add a function that says include
system timer
    - this function will set the cursor
      limit before it scrolls
          - how will this affect the print_bottom_left function though?
    - turn on the timer

i really like the idea of having screen modes that
we can select from.

we can have DEFAULT_MODE
we can have TIMER_MODE
and can expand to other modes

adding the logic to each of the screen printing functions
may be cumbersome. is there a way to do this
without having to go through and make one-by-one edits?

have functions that enable and disable the timer.
