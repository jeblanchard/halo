create an array that can handle the full amount of referencable
memory (4 GB i believe)
    - this is not the most optimal, but it is clean

create a variable sized bitmap
    - allocating the right amount
      of memory seems a little
      more tedious than what is
      worth it for this

allocate the memory during bootup
then reference that from within
the kernel
    - this feels nonlinear


how do i make sure there's free space for the bitmap?
    - i need to explicitly allocate it somehow
