The home for my operating system, `Halo`.

The Halo operating system is tested using Bochs, a 
hardware emulator. This means in order to easily see this
OS in action, you must have Bochs installed on your machine.

Refer to the `scripts` folder for project operations.

The TODO file holds project TODOs. Anytime a new TODO is
thought of or completed, edit this file accordingly.
