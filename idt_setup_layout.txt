given some handler, install_ir will generate asm?

maintain an array of interrupt handler addresses in order
to ensure nothing gets overwritten

create a file that has 256 interrupt handlers explicitly
declared

how do i generate the correct asm for each interrupt?

do i force each device to generate its own asm? this seems
to be the best option right now.
