have a small buffer specifically for
packets that are actively being received
from the nic?

maybe include a boolean that signifies
if a packet is actively being moved from
the nic to the host?

maybe the method that the ASM calls includes
a parameter for which byte the transfer is on?

have a start_byte_loading signal method
load all bytes into the host buffer
then send an end signal -> which would then transfer the
packet to the received bytes buffer
