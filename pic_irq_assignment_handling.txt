we could have a map that tracks
which IRQs are occupied

the map can hold the name of the
device. each device can have a variable
that holds its name.

the pic module should throw an error
when a device tries to add itself
to the PIC IRQ list

the PIC can also have a method that
prints out all devices that are
connected to it

the IDT should have something
very similar to handle well
known reserved routines

the PIC module and the IDT
module will communicate
heavily
